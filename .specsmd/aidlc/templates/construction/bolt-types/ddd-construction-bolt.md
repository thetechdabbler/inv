# Bolt Type: DDD Construction

## Mandatory Output Rules (READ FIRST)

- 🚫 **NEVER** use ASCII tables for options - they break at different terminal widths
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use numbered list format: `N - **Option**: Description`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use status indicators: ✅ (done) ⏳ (current) [ ] (pending) 🚫 (blocked)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Activities presented as numbered lists (not tables)
- ✅ Stage progress shown with status indicators
- ✅ Human checkpoints clearly marked

## Failure Modes

- ❌ Using ASCII table for activities
- ❌ Auto-advancing without human confirmation
- ❌ Skipping stages

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Stage Execution Sequence

**Stages MUST be executed in this exact order:**

```text
Stage 1: Domain Model → Stage 2: Technical Design → Stage 3: ADR Analysis (optional) → Stage 4: Implement → Stage 5: Test
```

**Stage Overview:**

- ✅/[ ] **1. Domain Model** (Required) → `ddd-01-domain-model.md`
- ✅/[ ] **2. Technical Design** (Required) → `ddd-02-technical-design.md`
- ✅/[ ] **3. ADR Analysis** (Optional) → `adr-{n}-{slug}.md` (zero or more)
- ✅/[ ] **4. Implement** (Required) → Source code
- ✅/[ ] **5. Test** (Required) → Tests + `ddd-03-test-report.md`

**Rules**:

- Each stage MUST be completed before the next begins
- Stage 3 can be skipped if no ADR-worthy decisions are identified
- **⛔ Human validation is MANDATORY at each stage checkpoint - STOP and WAIT for approval**
- NEVER skip to implementation without completing Domain Model and Technical Design
- NEVER auto-advance to next stage without explicit user confirmation

---

### Stage 3: ADR Analysis (Optional)

**Objective**: Capture significant architectural decisions before implementation

**Duration**: Minutes to hours (depends on complexity and number of ADRs)

**⛔ CONSTRAINTS**:

- **OPTIONAL**: This stage can be skipped if no ADR-worthy decisions are identified
- **REQUIRED**: Must have completed `Domain Model` and `Technical Design` stages first
- **OUTPUT**: ADR documents (if any created)

**When to Create ADRs**:

Suggest an ADR when you identify:

- **New architectural pattern not in standards**: CQRS, event sourcing, saga → Not in standards, affects future development
- **Technology choice not covered by tech-stack**: New library or service → Team should understand the rationale
- **Trade-off decision**: Performance vs simplicity, consistency vs availability → Documents "why" for future reference
- **Security/compliance approach**: Auth strategy, data handling → Critical decisions need justification
- **Integration pattern**: API design, event contracts → Affects other systems/teams
- **Intentional deviation from standards**: Exception with reasoning → Prevents confusion, documents reasoning

**Activities**:

1 - **Review domain model and technical design**: Understand decisions made
2 - **Compare against project standards**: Identify gaps
3 - **Identify ADR-worthy decisions**: Create decision list
4 - **Present opportunities to user**: Get user selection
5 - **Create ADR documents**: Generate selected ADRs
6 - **Update decision index**: Add entries to `memory-bank/standards/decision-index.md`

**Artifact**: `adr-{number}-{slug}.md` (zero or more)
**Template**: `.specsmd/aidlc/templates/construction/bolt-types/ddd-construction-bolt/adr-template.md`
**Location**: `memory-bank/bolts/{bolt-id}/adr-{number}-{slug}.md`

**ADR Analysis Process**:

1. Review stories, domain model, and technical design
2. Compare against loaded project standards
3. If decision-worthy patterns detected, present opportunities to user
4. Handle user response (create selected ADRs or skip)
5. Update decision index (if ADRs created) and proceed to checkpoint

**Step 3 Output Format**:

```markdown
## Potential ADR Opportunities

Based on this bolt's scope, I identified decisions that may benefit from an ADR:

1 - **{decision description}**: {why this warrants an ADR}
2 - **{decision description}**: {why this warrants an ADR}

Would you like to create ADRs for any of these? (Enter numbers, "all", or "skip")
```

**Step 4 Decision Handling**:

- **User selects numbers or "all"** → Generate ADRs using template, then update decision index
- **User selects "skip"** → Proceed to checkpoint with "No ADRs created"
- **No ADR opportunities identified** → Auto-proceed to checkpoint with "No ADR-worthy decisions found"

**Step 5 Decision Index Update**:

For each ADR created, add an entry to `memory-bank/standards/decision-index.md`:

1. If `decision-index.md` doesn't exist, create it from template: `.specsmd/aidlc/templates/standards/decision-index-template.md`
2. Add entry for each ADR in the following format:

```markdown
### ADR-{n}: {title}
- **Status**: {status from ADR frontmatter}
- **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD from ADR created timestamp}
- **Bolt**: {bolt-id} ({unit-name})
- **Path**: `bolts/{bolt-id}/adr-{n}-{slug}.md`
- **Summary**: {First sentence from Context section}. {First sentence from Decision section}.
- **Read when**: {Generate guidance based on the ADR's domain - describe scenarios when agents should read this ADR}
```

Update frontmatter: increment `total_decisions`, update `last_updated` timestamp

**"Read when" Guidance Examples**:

- "Working on authentication flows or session management"
- "Implementing caching strategies or data persistence patterns"
- "Designing API contracts or integration points"
- "Handling error cases or implementing retry logic"

**Example ADR**:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use CQRS for Task Queries

## Context
Task list requires complex filtering and sorting that doesn't align with write model.

## Decision
Implement CQRS pattern with separate read models for task queries.

## Rationale
- Write model optimized for domain invariants
- Read model optimized for query performance
- Allows independent scaling

## Consequences
- Additional complexity in sync
- Need event-driven updates to read model
```

**Completion Criteria**:

- [ ] Domain model and technical design reviewed for decisions
- [ ] Project standards compared
- [ ] User presented with ADR opportunities (if any)
- [ ] Selected ADRs created (or explicitly skipped)
- [ ] Decision index updated (if ADRs were created)

**Important**: Do not force ADRs. Only suggest when there's genuine value. Simple bolts with straightforward decisions don't need ADRs.

**⛔ HUMAN Checkpoint**: Present ADR summary (created or skipped) and **STOP**. Wait for user to confirm before proceeding to Stage 4.

## State Tracking

Bolt instance tracks progress:

```yaml
---
current_stage: design
stages_completed:
  - name: model
    completed: 2024-12-05T10:00:00Z
    artifact: ddd-01-domain-model.md
status: in-progress

## Bolt Context Loading

### Prior Decision Lookup (All Stages)

**Before starting any stage**, scan the decision index for relevant prior ADRs:

1. Read `memory-bank/standards/decision-index.md` (if it exists)
2. Match the current bolt's domain/scope against "Read when" fields
3. Load full ADRs for any matching entries
4. Consider these decisions as constraints or guidance for the current work

**Example**: If working on a bolt for "user-service" and the decision index contains:

```text
### ADR-001: Use JWT for Authentication
- **Read when**: Working on authentication flows or user services
```

→ Load and consider `ADR-001` before starting design work.

**Present relevant ADRs to user** at bolt start:

```text
## Relevant Prior Decisions

Found {n} ADR(s) that may apply to this bolt:
- ADR-001: Use JWT for Authentication → [View](bolts/001-auth-service/adr-001-jwt-auth.md)

These decisions may constrain or guide your approach. Proceed? (y/n)
```

### Bolt Folder Artifacts (Stages 4-5)

For stages that build on previous work (Stage 4: Implement, Stage 5: Test), load all artifacts from the bolt folder:

**Location**: `memory-bank/bolts/{bolt-id}/`

**Load all files in this folder**, which may include:

- `bolt.md` - Bolt instance metadata
- `ddd-01-domain-model.md` - Domain model from Stage 1
- `ddd-02-technical-design.md` - Technical design from Stage 2
- `adr-*.md` - Any ADRs from Stage 3

This ensures the implementation and test stages have full context from earlier design work.

---

## Usage by Construction Agent

1. **Load bolt instance** from path defined by `schema.bolts`
2. **Read `bolt_type` field** (e.g., `ddd-construction-bolt`)
3. **Load this definition** from `.specsmd/aidlc/templates/construction/bolt-types/`
4. **Scan decision index** for relevant prior ADRs (see Prior Decision Lookup)
5. **Present relevant ADRs** to user if any found, get confirmation to proceed
6. **Check `current_stage`** in bolt instance
7. **Load bolt folder artifacts** if stage requires previous context (see Bolt Folder Artifacts)
8. **Execute stage** following activities defined here
9. **Create artifacts** using templates
10. **⛔ STOP and present completion summary** - DO NOT continue automatically
11. **Wait for user confirmation** - user must explicitly approve (e.g., "continue", "proceed", "next")
12. **Only after approval**: Update bolt state and advance to next stage

**⛔ CRITICAL**: Steps 10-11 are MANDATORY. Never skip the human checkpoint. Never auto-advance.

The Construction Agent is **bolt-type agnostic** - it reads stages from this file and executes them.
